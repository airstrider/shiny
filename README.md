Hello reviewers,

I am Jung Kim. Thank you for your interest in my very first shiny app. Let me introduce the simple app that I developed.

# Introduction
To begin with, this app is a sort of fund calculator. It provides users with the way to predict the future value of their own fund products in adopting two kinds of interest rates, compound interest rate and simple interest rate.
In general people know that compound interest rate would give us better profits than simple interest rate. 
However, it would be hard for ordinary people to figure out immediately how much more benefit they could get.

For this reason, I developed a simple but useful fund calculator in order to help people to predict future values of their financial properties in an easy way.

# Theoretical backgoround
This app uses two types of formula following:
- Formula for compound interest: principal * (1+interest rate)^maturity ---[1]
- Formula for simple interest: principal * (1+(interest rate*maturity)) ---[2]
- The difference: [1] - [2]

# Usage
Let's see how to use it. It provides you with a quite easy and intuitive usage. In other words, just input three values that you want, and you will be able to immediately get the prediction.

Step1. 
On the left side of the screen you can see three input values such as the amount of principal, interest rate and maturity.

Step2. 
Just input three values that you want. For example, you can input a numereric value as the principal in the principal field. The default value is $50000.00. 
You can setup the amount of principal you want by directly typing or clicking up&down arrow button of the field.

Step3.
You will be able to check the refreshed result instantly when you input or edit some of three vlaues. The result will show two future values and the difference of the future values with between compound interest and simple interest 
Therefore, you can predict two future values of your fund product as well as which interest rate would give you better result.

# Conclusion
In breif, using this app, users will be able to not only build their own customized fund products with three input values, which are the amount of principal, interest rate and maturity but also get quick results including the difference between two future values.
I hope this help you make richer.

Thank you

Jung Kim
